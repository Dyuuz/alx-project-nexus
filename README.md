# ALX Project Nexus

## Overview

**ALX Project Nexus** is a documentation hub that captures my major learnings, experiences, and technical growth throughout the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** by ALX.

This repository serves as a central reference point for:
- Core backend engineering concepts
- Tools and technologies explored
- Challenges encountered and how they were solved
- Best practices and personal engineering takeaways

The goal is not just to document *what* was learned, but *how* and *why* those learnings matter in real-world backend systems.
